# ChipSecuritySystem - sequence finder

Assumptions I used:
* Chip colors: Though not explicitly stated I assumed the colors could be reversed (i.e. first chip could have StartColor or EndColor as Blue). I added a helper method to make checking this easier.
* Multiple paths: I assumed based on the instructions that we wanted the longest path

See (and run) `ChipsEvaluatorTests.cs` for the test sets of chips.
